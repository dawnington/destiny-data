# Destiny Data

[Live on Heroku](https://destiny-data.herokuapp.com/)

A simple site that uses the Bungie API to fetch and display PvP stats as percentages, inspired by this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/4rp01r/ideal_breakdown_of_kill_types/) and [featured on Game Rant](http://gamerant.com/destiny-pvp-stat-site-311/).

Built using React/flux, Express, and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

Many thanks to [chrisfried](https://github.com/chrisfried/secret-scrubland) for giving me the base to work off of. Check out his app if you haven't already (and if you want to feel bad about how much time you've spent on Destiny).

`routes/index.js` requires a [Bungie API Key](https://www.bungie.net/en/User/API)
